I am the Founder of [CatalystNeuro](http://catalystneuro.com), a consulting and software development company that facilitates collaboration in neuroscience.
We believe that the future of neuroscience will be driven by collaboration between labs. Our mission is to develop channels of communication and distribution of resources between labs to enable exponential growth and innovation. We are at the forefront of this effort, shaping the way data, analysis and visualization tools are standardized and shared across the international community of systems neuroscientists. We ensure that these tools accelerate scientific discovery by working in parallel with neuroscientists and work with them to enhance the tools they already use.

I have been fortunate enough to find a team of like-minded neuroscientists and software developers, and together we are finding ways to contribute to the field outside of the standard academic path.
I am strong advocate for non-traditional paths in science. If you are curious about carving your own path and you want to learn how others have done it, feel free to contact me via email.

## Background
I received my Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the [UC Berkeley - UCSF Joint Program in Bioengineering](http://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/), in [Dr. Edward Chang's lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/).
There I used electrocorticography (ECoG) to study the neural control of speech in humans.
Much of this work focused on how we control the pitch of our voice when we speak and sing.

I did my undergraduate work at the University of Pittsburgh, and I learned many of the skills I still use on a regular basis in in the [SMILE lab](https://smile.pitt.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. Aaron Batista.
