I am a Research Software Engineer and the Founder of [CatalystNeuro](http://catalystneuro.com), where I work to transform how neuroscience labs collaborate and share data.

## Vision & Work

At CatalystNeuro, we're revolutionizing neuroscience collaboration through better data standardization and tool sharing. Our work focuses on:

- Developing standardized data formats for neuroscience
- Creating tools for seamless data sharing between labs
- Building bridges between different analysis platforms
- Consulting with labs to optimize their data workflows

We believe the future of neuroscience lies in open collaboration, and we're actively shaping how data and tools are shared across the international neuroscience community.

## Background

I received my Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the [UC Berkeley - UCSF Joint Program in Bioengineering](http://bioegrad.berkeley.edu/), working in [Dr. Edward Chang's lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/). My research focused on using electrocorticography (ECoG) to understand speech control in humans, particularly the neural mechanisms of voice pitch control in speaking and singing.

During my undergraduate years at the University of Pittsburgh's [SMILE lab](https://smile.pitt.edu/) under [Dr. Aaron Batista](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/AaronBatista/), I developed probabilistic models of neural activity. This early work shaped my approach to neural data analysis and eventually led to my interest in standardizing data practices across the field.

## Alternative Paths in Science

I'm passionate about exploring non-traditional careers in science. Through CatalystNeuro, I've found a way to contribute to neuroscience beyond the conventional academic path. I work with a talented team of neuroscientists and software developers who share this vision.

If you're interested in exploring alternative careers in science or want to learn about different paths, feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to share experiences and discuss possibilities.

## Beyond the Lab

When not working on neuroscience data, I enjoy:
- Dancing West Coast Swing
- Traveling and exploring new cultures
