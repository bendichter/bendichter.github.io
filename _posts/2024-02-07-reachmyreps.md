## What is ReachMyReps?

ReachMyReps is a simple but powerful web application that helps you connect with your representatives in government. The process is straightforward: First, you enter your address to find your representatives at all levels of government. Then you can choose from common topics or write about your own issue. Using AI, the app generates a personalized, professional letter about your chosen topic. Finally, you can review and edit the letter before sending it directly to your representatives.

## Why I Built This

In today's complex political landscape, it's more important than ever for citizens to make their voices heard. However, many people find it challenging to engage with their representatives. Finding accurate contact information can be time-consuming. Writing effective, professional letters requires skill and practice. And in our busy lives, finding time to engage in the democratic process often falls to the bottom of our priority list.

ReachMyReps removes these barriers by automating the tedious parts while keeping you in control of the message.

## How It Works

The app combines several technologies to make civic engagement easier. Through address lookup, it identifies your representatives accurately. The AI-powered letter generation creates personalized, contextual content based on your input. And with direct delivery functionality, your message reaches your representatives without hassle.
